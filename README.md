##Overview

BookWyrm is a book finder site enabling the user to send queries to the Google Books API and recieve responses in the form of cards.  The user can expand a modal by clicking a card to get more information on a given book, they can also save it to a booklist, pin it to their home page or visit the Google Books page for that book, via buttons in modal. 

The aim of the project is to provide a clean and simple interface to search for and save books.  Although Google Books itself is an excellent resource there seemed to be an opening for site that allows the user to see the results quickly, at a glance in the form of cards.
